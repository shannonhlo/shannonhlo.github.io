## Hello!

I am an analytics professional on a mission to serve insights that would make sense to most 5 year olds.

In the last 3 years, I've enjoyed evangelizing the value of data analytics within my circle of influence. At Best Buy Canada, I provide insights, analytics products and deliver data stories that embolden decision makers to improve the Canadian shopping experience. I've also enjoyed consulting for small businesses wanting to leverage digital to increase revenue or improve efficiencies.

In my spare time, I like to contribute to the growth of sports cards collecting and investing in Canada. Specifically, building analytics products and writing data-driven blog posts for investors and collectors looking to make more informed buying decisions. Check out my [sports cards site](https://www.goatsportscards.com/) here.
