Hi there! I am a data scientist with a passion for using data to develop a deeper understanding of the world.

In my eight years as a data professional, I have also been a **data translator** who turns raw data into insights used by decision makers, a **data analyst** who finds optimization opportunties through analyses and creates dasboards to understand performance, and a **pseudo data engineer** who creates ETL pipelines and automates time-consuming manual processes. Emphasis on the pseudo part. I was standing in for a vacant data engineer role in my job as a data analyst.

When I'm not geeking out about data, you can usually find me hiking, rock climbing, or camping. I also enjoy travelling and recently returned from a year-long trip where I got to experience life as a digital nomad while exploring various countries.
