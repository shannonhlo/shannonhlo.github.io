Hi there! I am a data scientist with a passion for using data to develop a deeper understanding of the world.

In my four years as a data professional, I have also been a **data translator** who turns raw data into insights used by decision makers, a **data analyst** who finds optimization opportunties through analyses and creates dasboards to understand performance, and a **pseudo data engineer** who creates ETL pipelines and automates time-consuming manual processes. Emphasis on the pseudo part. I was standing in for a vacant data engineer role in my day job as a data analyst.

Outside of work, I am active in the local data community as an avid participant in local meet ups and hackathons/datathons like those hosted by [Data for Good](https://dataforgood.ca/) and [hackseq](https://www.hackseq.com/).

When I'm not geeking out about data, you can usually find me hiking, snowshoeing, or camping. I also volunteer at a local Army Cadet unit ([2381 RCACC](https://2381armycadets.com/)), providing mentorship and guidance to help senior cadets grow their leadership and instructional abilities.
