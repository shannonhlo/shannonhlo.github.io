This workshop is part of the [Vancouver DataJam 2021](https://www.vancouverdatajam.ca/#home) event. It will equip participants with the basics of Git, a version control software, and how to collaborate with others on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

There are three parts:
* [Part 1](https://shannonhlo.github.io/projects/git-github-workshop1/) details installation and set up instructions
* [Part 2](https://shannonhlo.github.io/projects/git-github-workshop2/) introduces the concept of version control, Git, and GitHub
* [Part 3](https://shannonhlo.github.io/projects/git-github-workshop3/) contains hands-on exercises where participants will create a repository in GitHub, make their first commit, and become familiar with other common Git commands

## Before we start, here are some useful resources
Install Git and create a GitHub account using the instructions in [Part 1 of this workshop here](https://shannonhlo.github.io/projects/git-github-workshop1/).

If you already have Git and GitHub set up and you're looking for a refresher, check out this [Git Cheat Sheet](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet).
